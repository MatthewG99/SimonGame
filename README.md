# Simon Game

This repository contains the implementation of the classic Simon game, a simple yet challenging memory game. 

## Overview

The Simon game is a memory game where the player must remember and repeat a sequence of colors. The game starts when the user presses a key. The game will then show the first color in the sequence and the user must click the correct color. If the user's answer is correct, the game will show the next color in the sequence. The user must then click the colors in the correct order. The sequence gets longer and faster with each level, challenging the user's memory and reaction speed.
